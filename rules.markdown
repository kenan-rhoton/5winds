# The Five Winds of War

## Phase 0: Today and Tomorrow

- Roll 10 WoW dice and randomly split them in two groups of 5: Today's Dice and Tomorrow's Dice. From now on, for the rest of the game, players may only use Today's Dice. When they're exhausted, Tomorrow's Dice become Today's Dice and the exhausted dice are rerolled into a new Tomorrow's Dice pool.
- These dice have 6 possible values:
    1. Earth
    2. Heaven
    3. Fire
    4. Shadow
    5. Iron
    6. The Ever-Changing Wind (when this is picked, your opponent bans one of the other five Winds, and you must choose one of the four remaining ones)

## Phase 1: Scenario building

- Players consult the table according to which result currently appears the most in the dice to choose the Scenario.
- Players fairly and randomly decide which side of the table will be their Home Side.
- Players take turns taking a die and using it to place a terrain feature according to the Terrain Placement Chart, until 10 features have been placed.
